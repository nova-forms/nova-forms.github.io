## Made For The Web

Nova Forms makes heavy use of the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and it's features. Rust code can be compiled to [WebAssembly](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm) which allows running interactive websites on the browser, entirely without JavaScript!

Nova Forms is built on top of [Leptos](https://leptos.dev), a cutting-edge Rust framework for the modern web.
This not only makes Nova Forms extremely fast, but also saves lots of server costs.
