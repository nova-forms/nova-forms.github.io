## Fully Featured

From form input, translation, validation, submission to PDF rendering, we got you covered.

<div class="steps">
    {% include step.html number=1 title="Validation" description="The user-provided input is validated using our novel approach of type-based validation." %}
    {% include step.html number=2 title="Submission" description="The form data is submitted to a server function, we take care of the networking." %}
    {% include step.html number=3 title="Processing" description="Easily render the to PDF using our provided PDF rendering service, or really do anything you want with the form data." %}
</div>

## Made For The Web

Nova Forms makes heavy use of the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and it's features. Rust code can be compiled to [WebAssembly](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm) which allows running interactive websites on the browser, entirely without JavaScript!

## Blazingly Fast

Nova Forms is built on top of [Leptos](https://leptos.dev), a cutting-edge Rust framework for the modern web.
This not only makes Nova Forms extremely fast, but also saves server costs.
