    {% include step.html number=2 title="Input Validation" description="The user-provided input is validated in real-time in the frontend, as well as after submission in the backend using our novel approach of type-based validation." %}
    {% include step.html number=3 title="Data Submission" description="There is no need to implement your own API, simply declare a server function that takes the form data as an input, the networking is taken care of." %}
    {% include step.html number=4 title="PDF Creation" description="Easily render the form to PDF using our provided PDF rendering service in a single line of code." %}

## Made For The Web

Nova Forms makes heavy use of the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and it's features. Rust code can be compiled to [WebAssembly](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm) which allows running interactive websites on the browser, entirely without JavaScript!

## Blazingly Fast

Nova Forms is built on top of [Leptos](https://leptos.dev), a cutting-edge Rust framework for the modern web.
This not only makes Nova Forms extremely fast, but also saves lots of server costs.
